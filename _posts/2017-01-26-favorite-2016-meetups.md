title: Favorite 2016 Meetups
---
Though I do not consider myself an extrovert, I love meeting people through tech events and conferences.

As I start filling my calendar with events, here's a recap of my favorites from last year:

#### How Women Power Intel Open Source - February 8

On International Women's Day 2016, I enjoyed learning how the women of [Intel Open Source Technology Center](https://01.org/) contribute and drive software in everything from Security, IoT, Android, Chrome OS, QA, and UX.

Normally I'd gravitate to UX or IoT, but I adored the security discussion and credit Constanza Heath and Terri Oda for sparking my interest. Check out their fun security tutorials, [Sparkle Security](https://github.com/terriko/sparklesecurity).

It was amazing to hear from the passionate ladies of Intel OTC, who stayed well past the scheduled end of the event to answer our questions. Awesome networking event to kick off 2016!

#### Intel Professional Development & Career Series - February 12

I can never say no to professional development workshops, so I headed over to Intel on this chilly Saturday. There were two workshops: Playing the Jungle Gym and Behavioral Matrix. Though the Behavioral Matrix workshop reinforced different communication styles, I really enjoyed Betsy Tong's workshop.

As Senior Director of Intel Data Center Group, Betsy shared her non-linear career path and offered tips on approaching a more fulfilling career path. The Sheryl Sanders quote that Betsy shared with us is now my mantra:

> Careers are a jungle gym, not a ladder.

#### PDXWIT Happy Hour Networking Event at CorSource - August 23

It was so awesome to close out the summer with a happy hour event at CorSource! Though there was an introduction to [CorSource](http://www.corsource.com/) and engaging lightning talks from Kristina King and Stephanie Duncker, this event was primarily geared towards networking.

Though I had many charming conversations with other professionals, I found myself having a long and energetic discussion with a QA engineer. We talked about her role at a local fraud prevention company, her transition from developer to QA engineer, and her thoughts on scrum. Her enthusiasm for both her work and her employer was so infectious, I had an informational interview with her manager in the coming weeks.

#### PDX TechCrawl - September 8  

It was such a gorgeous afternoon to eat, drink and walk our way through Portland companies during the 5th Annual TechCrawl! After checking in and examining the map, we hiked our way through downtown to get a glimpse of different tech offices. Out of the 20+ offices, we managed to squeeze in 6 tech companies:

* iovation
* Jama Software
* New Relic
* Puppet
* Vacasa
* WebTrends

Though it felt a little claustrophobic cramming into spaces with over a thousand other attendees, we were often rewarded with gorgeous views, friendly hosts, or classic arcade games.

#### Open Hardware Summit - October 7

I was one of the lucky few to earn a free ticket to this summit, thanks to WWC Portland and the organizers of the [Open Hardware Summit](http://2016.oshwa.org/). I wanted to learn more about IoT and hardware, but was stunned by the diverse and inclusive open hardware community.

Any feelings of doubt or downright awkwardness were erased once I entered the Crystal Ballroom. I met a few ladies from WWC and we gleefully explored our hardware swag bags together. From Allison Parrish's keynote, [Programming is Forgetting: Toward a New Hacker Ethic](http://opentranscripts.org/transcript/programming-forgetting-new-hacker-ethic/), to getting up close and personal with Sev Leonard's Internet of Cats, OHS was hands down the most eye-opening event of 2016.
