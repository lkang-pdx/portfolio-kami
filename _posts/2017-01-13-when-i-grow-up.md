title: When I Grow Up 
---
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

I remember confidently answering this question as a five year old: doctor, veterinarian, chef, and rock star. I reasoned with my mother than I could be a doctor during the day, veterinarian by night, and chef/rock star on the weekends. What I hadn't anticipated, in my infinite wisdom, was that the very thought of needles would make me gag as an adult and that I would rather leave my food and music to the professionals. Alas, my mother would never see her only daughter wearing bedazzled scrubs while preparing three course meals.

When it came time to select a major, I ran with my interest in the web and chose Computer Science. Being a stellar high school student, I was destroyed when I was placed on academic probation freshman year. Calculus and C++ befuddled me at first pass, but I eventually conquered the concepts the second time around. I finally felt at ease when I transferred to Business, with a minor in Information Systems. Learning about foreign keys in relational databases and how to build a shopping cart simply felt like the perfect fit. Before I knew it, I graduated college with hopes of a career in either quality assurance or project management.

Even now, I still can't believe my luck. I was able to focus on quality assurance as a digital producer in EdTech and project management as a consultant. But a few years ago, I started to feel restless. My interest in web development resurfaced constantly and motivated me to complete a WordPress course, learn JavaScript fundamentals, and read about UX design.

At the right time and place in my career, I took the plunge and signed up for an intensive full stack web development program. Like my C++ days, it wasn't all rainbows and butterflies. My insecurities as a coder reemerged when struggling to learn how to nest loops in JavaScript. The first few months were filled with recurring nightmares of bombing my first C++ final. But with the help of a caring community of students and mentors, I hammered through the tough curriculum and now have over six projects in my portfolio.

While I am unsure where my full stack web development skills will take me in the future, I am, at the very least, comforted knowing that it doesn't involve needles.
